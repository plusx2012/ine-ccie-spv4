1. XR1 is running IS-IS level-1 while others are running level-2

2. R3 running wrong OSPF network type to XR2.

3. XR1 has wrong OSPF domain ID for VRF B process.

4. R2 is not sending VPNv4 extended communities to XR4.

5. R13 has wrong import/export policy under VRF CE.

Lab 2

1. R6's Loopback0 is in area 0.  Requires virtual link R1-R6, R7-XR3, sham-link R1-XR3, higher cost R7 to R3

2. R18 is not advertising Loopback0 into IS-IS, which breaks LDP

3. XR2 has TTL security breaking peering to XR4, and has wrong RPL for outbound routes

4. XR1 has passive BGP peer and ACL blocking the TCP connection to start from R8

5. R12 has wrong bgp next hop
